Parallel Programming
Parallel programming is used whenin the execution flow is broken up into smmall pieces and can be done in concurrently by multicore, processors .
That is, many calculation are carried out simultaneously.

Parallel Programming take advantake of multicore

Data Parallelism: Operation happen on each piece of data simultaneously --> Partitioning Data
Parallel.For
parallel.Foreach

Task Parallelism: task are executed independently. That is each function exexute diffect code section independently --> Partitioning Task
Parallel.Invoke


PFX=> PLINQ +Parallel Class

Task Parallel Programming => Recommended way




 In case of Parallel cancellation token whould not cancel the task , and it will lead to RanTocomplition, so we need to cancel Method as well
